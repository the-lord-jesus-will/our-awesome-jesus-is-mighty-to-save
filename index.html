        <p><span>BLOW ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the
            land
            tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for </span><em><span>it</span></em><span>
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> nigh at hand;</span></p>
        <p><span>2 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread
            upon
            the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more
            after
            it, </span><em><span>even</span></em><span> to the years of many generations.</span></p>
        <p><span>3 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate
            wilderness;
            yea, and nothing shall escape them.</span></p>
        <p><span>4 The appearance of them </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> as the appearance of horses; and as
            horsemen, so shall they run.</span></p>
        <p><span>5 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of
            fire
            that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</span></p>
        <p><span>6 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.</span></p>
        <p><span>7 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every
            one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:</span></p>
        <p><span>8 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and
          </span><em><span>when</span></em><span> they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.</span></p>
        <p><span>9 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the
            houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.</span></p>
        <p><span>10 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark,
            and
            the stars shall withdraw their shining:</span></p>
        <p><span>11 And the Lord shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span>
            very great: for </span><em><span>he</span></em><span> </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> strong that
            executeth his word: for the day of the Lord </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> great and very terrible;
            and
            who can abide it?</span></p>
        <p><span>12 Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye </span><em><span>even</span></em><span> to me with all
            your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</span></p>
        <p><span>13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and
            repenteth
            him of the evil.</span></p>
        <p><span>14 Who knoweth </span><em><span>if</span></em><span> he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
            behind him; </span><em><span>even</span></em><span> a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your
            God?</span></p>
        <p><span>15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:</span></p>
        <p><span>16 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those
            that
            suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</span></p>
        <p><span>17 Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say,
            Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them:
            wherefore should they say among the people, Where </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> their God?</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>18 Then will the Lord be jealous for his land, and pity his people.</span></p>
        <p><span>19 Yea, the Lord will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil,
            and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:</span></p>
        <p><span>20 But I will remove far off from you the northern </span><em><span>army</span></em><span>, and will
            drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the
            utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great
            things.</span></p>
        <p><span>21 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the Lord will do great things.</span></p>
        <p><span>22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree
            beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.</span></p>
        <p><span>23 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for he hath given you the
            former
            rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in
            the
            first </span><em><span>month</span></em><span>.</span></p>
        <p><span>24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil.</span></p>
        <p><span>25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller,
            and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.</span></p>
        <p><span>26 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, that hath
            dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.</span></p>
        <p><span>27 And ye shall know that I </span><em><span>am</span></em><span> in the midst of Israel, and
          </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> I </span><em><span>am</span></em><span> the Lord your God, and none
            else: and my people shall never be ashamed.</span></p>
        <p><span>28 And it shall come to pass afterward, </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> I will pour out my
            spirit
            upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young
            men shall see visions:</span></p>
        <p><span>29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of
            smoke.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible
            day
            of the Lord come.</span></p>
        <p><span>32 And it shall come to pass, </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> whosoever shall call on the name
            of
            the Lord shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said,
            and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.</span></p>

        <p><span>THE burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from </span><em><span>being</span></em><span> a
            city,
            and it shall be a ruinous heap.</span></p>
        <p><span>2 The cities of Aroer </span><em><span>are</span></em><span> forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which
            shall
            lie down, and none shall make </span><em><span>them</span></em><span> afraid.</span></p>
        <p><span>3 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria:
            they
            shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the Lord of hosts.</span></p>
        <p><span>4 And in that day it shall come to pass, </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> the glory of Jacob
            shall be
            made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.</span></p>
        <p><span>5 And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it
            shall be
            as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.</span></p>
        <p><span>6 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two
          </span><em><span>or</span></em><span> three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four
          </span><em><span>or</span></em><span> five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the Lord God of
            Israel.</span></p>
        <p><span>7 At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of
            Israel.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>8 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect
          </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>9 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left
            because
            of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.</span></p>
        <p><span>10 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy
            strength,
            therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips:</span></p>
        <p><span>11 In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to
            flourish:
          </span><em><span>but</span></em><span> the harvest </span><em><span>shall</span></em><span>
          </span><em><span>be</span></em><span> a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.</span></p>
        <p><span>12 Woe to the multitude of many people, </span><em><span>which</span></em><span> make a noise like the
            noise of
            the seas; and to the rushing of nations, </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> make a rushing like the
            rushing of
            mighty waters!</span></p>
        <p><span>13 The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but </span><em><span>God</span></em><span>
            shall
            rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
            and
            like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.</span></p>
        <p><span>14 And behold at eveningtide trouble; </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> before the morning he
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> not. This </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> the portion of them that
